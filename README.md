This is a Hubot script that returns the current odds of doom.

## Installation

I'm assuming you already have Hubot up and running. Copy odds-of-doom.coffee to
the `scripts` folder.

You'll also want to make sure `request` is installed. Hubot will also need to
make a HTTPS request to the Betfair API.
